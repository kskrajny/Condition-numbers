##  Introduction
This is my project for WNE UW course called "Program R w zastosowaniach ekonomicznych i finansowych". \
My goal was to analyze how choice of a norm influence the condition number of matrices. \

## Dataset
In order to gain data for this project I created a script. \
This script: \
- generates some square matrices using normal distribution \
- counts condition numbers of matrices based on different norms \
- saves it to csv (size of data that I generated makes it unnecessary actually) \

Theses are norms that i used: \
  - 2-norm \
  - Frobenius norm \
  - max norm \
  - infinity norm \
  
```{r}
# number of matrices
K<-1000

# size of matrix
N<-10

# normal distribution parameters
sd<-100
mean<-0

# containers for conditions
norm2_cond <- numeric(0)
normF_cond <- numeric(0)
normM_cond <- numeric(0)
normI_cond <- numeric(0)

# main
for (i in 1:K) {
  A <- matrix( rnorm(N*N, mean, sd), N, N)
  AI <- solve(A)
  norm2_cond <- append(norm2_cond, norm(A, '2')*norm(AI, '2'))
  normF_cond <- append(normF_cond, norm(A, 'F')*norm(AI, 'F'))
  normM_cond <- append(normM_cond, norm(A, 'M')*norm(AI, 'M'))
  normI_cond <- append(normI_cond, norm(A, 'I')*norm(AI, 'I'))
}

df<-data.frame(norm2_cond, normF_cond, normM_cond, normI_cond)
write.csv(df, paste(getwd(), "/conditions.csv", sep=""), row.names = FALSE)

head(df)
```
## Summmary table

```{r}
summary(df)
```
We see that the largest values are extremely different that others. \
It means that even if we could properly count most of the equations with matrices. \
There are some matrices that we probably shouldn't even try to use.  \

## Density plots

This is a diagram that shows density distributions that are made from conditional numbers. \
As we expected, there are a lot of relatively small values. \
Shapes are very similar to each other. \
We can suppose that correlation between these functions is very high. \

```{r}
melted <- melt(df)

ggplot(melted, aes(x=value, fill=variable)) +
    geom_density(alpha=0.25) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("red", "blue", "orange", "green")) +
    geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(norm2_cond)), color="red", linetype="dashed", size=1) +
    geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(normF_cond)), color="blue", linetype="dashed", size=1) +
    geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(normM_cond)), color="orange", linetype="dashed", size=1) +
    geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(normI_cond)), color="green", linetype="dashed", size=1) +
    scale_x_continuous(trans='log2')
```

## Correlations between condition numbers based on different norms

As we thought, these functions correlate with each other totally. \
This might mean that no matter what norm we choose to check condition number,
we get similar information about difficulty that this matrix can cause during calculations.

```{r}
C <-cor(df)
corrplot(C, type="upper", order="hclust",
         col=brewer.pal(n=8, name="RdYlBu"))
```

## Summary

If it comes to matrices created using normal distribution,
there is no big difference what norm we choose to count condition number.
